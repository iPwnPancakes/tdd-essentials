# 4. State Machines

This one should be about teaching you to design out stateful objects by first documenting them as state machines. 

This is effectively you doing step #1 of the ideal approach to te physical (understand the problem).

> Notes: let's just get this to the point where you can at least get one or two victory states mapped out. From there, we'll shift over to the next exercise, which is to learn how to refactor these things a little better.

> Notes: Optionally, put an even simpler example to start with. Like, an information holder - such as `Content` or something, that has several states, and can only be changed for certain reasons.
