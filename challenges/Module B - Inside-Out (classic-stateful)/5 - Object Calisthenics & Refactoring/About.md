# 5. Object Calisthenics

> For this exercise, the focus is on using the basics of object calisthenics to set a baseline for what is acceptable quality for the objects we create. These rules will help you write better object-oriented code by forcing you to think about what you're doing.

> Notes: We will eventually introduce Object Stereotypes, but first, the idea is to focus on some basic rules.

> We will be starting from where we left off w/ the previous exercise, which means the previous exercise has to be extremely well defined. Just have the concrete deliverables for what will make it complete written there.

> Or perhaps, instead of that, take my messy code example and I'll make you refactor it to object calisthenics.

> Notes: Ah, I can also give you a refactoring challenge here
