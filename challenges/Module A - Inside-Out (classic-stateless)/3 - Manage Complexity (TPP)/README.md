# 3. Manage Complexity (TPP)

> This one is all about learning how to keep your solutions as simple as possible.

> Here, we talk about transformations and learn that certain transformations clutter the design and make it harder for you to progress. 

> That is, it's easy for you to carve yourself into an "impasse" when you choose more complex transformations. If you choose simpler transformations, it becomes less likely you'll run into the problem.
